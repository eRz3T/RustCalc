# RustCalc

Basic calculator made in Rust 
Hello and welcome! My name is Bartek, and I am delighted to share with you my first project written in the Rust programming language. 
As I embark on this exciting journey, I find myself using Vim as my text editor to write this code.
Additionally, I am utilizing Git in the terminal to manage my version control.
Thank you for joining me on this adventure, and I hope you find my project enjoyable and informative!

Best regards,
Bartek
